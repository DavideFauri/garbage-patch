# garbage-patch
Generate fake but realistic data and send them via POST to phishing websites

## What is it?

This tool is used to pollute the credentials dataset that phishing websites are collecting.

## Why would I use it?

They want user data? I'm giving them user data.

## How do I use it?

TODO

### garbage-patch.py

This is the thing.

### genexp.py

This is a module for generative expressions; I should probably write down the syntax

### http_listener.py

You use this for testing

## Where do I get wordlists?

Some good repositories for wordlists are:

### Italian

https://github.com/napolux/paroleitaliane

### English

https://github.com/duyet/bruteforce-database
